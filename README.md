RevNotesOrder
-----
A little script I wrote to convert my evernote notes to a format I can use on my kindle paperwhite.

**REQUIRES NOTES IN EVERNOTE**
- Merge desired notes in Evernote
- export big note which results from that
- delete big note in Evernote, recover old notes from trash
- place RevNotesOrder in same directory as notes
- run: $ RevNotesOrder your_notes_file.html (will create FLIPPED_your_notes_file.html)
- use Calibre or some other software to convert to .azw3 if desired, generate Table of Contents from main headings (Calibre has 'smarten punctuation' tool too, which is useful).
- send to kindle!
